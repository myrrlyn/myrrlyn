### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you're reading this, you're probably wondering why I'm not answering any of my issues on `bitvec`. Well, I've been house shopping ever since I released 1.0, and I'm moving across the country (again, hopefully for the last time) at the end of May. Once I'm set up, have Internet access again, etc, I'll resume working on it.

Sorry for the absence and, more notably, the silence. In the past I've been juggling a full-time job and `bitvec` with not much of a life; now I'm juggling a full-time job and a life with not much `bitvec`, so my limit appears to be two. Working on it.
